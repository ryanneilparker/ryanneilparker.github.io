✔ **Lifeguard & Water Safety Experience** – Ensuring guest and crew safety in marine environments.  
✔ **Efficiency & Precision** – My engineering background means I don’t just do the job—I find the smartest way to do it right.  
✔ **Software & Technical Skills** – From deck operations to onboard technology, I adapt quickly to complex systems.
