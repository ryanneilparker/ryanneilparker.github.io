## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Prepare the Work Area
- Ensure the deck is free of any loose debris.
- Remove any furniture, mats, or covers that could be affected by the acid.
- Wet the entire deck using the freshwater hose.

### 2. Mix the Oxalic Acid Solution
- Fill a bucket with **warm water** (about 4 liters/1 gallon).
- Add **one cup of oxalic acid powder** and stir until fully dissolved.
- For stubborn stains, use a slightly stronger mixture (1.5 cups per gallon).

**Pro Tip:** Always add **acid to water**, never the other way around, to prevent dangerous splashes.

### 3. Apply the Solution
- Use a soft deck brush or white scrub pad to apply the solution evenly.
- Work in **small sections** (around 1m x 1m / 3ft x 3ft) to prevent the solution from drying too quickly.
- Allow it to sit for **5-10 minutes**, depending on the severity of the stains.

**Pro Tip:** Avoid letting the solution dry on the deck, as it can cause uneven results.

### 4. Scrub the Teak
- Gently scrub **against the grain** using a soft bristle brush or white/red Scotch-Brite pad.
- Pay extra attention to **dark spots and high-traffic areas**.
- Avoid using excessive pressure to prevent wearing down the teak.

### 5. Rinse Thoroughly
- Use a **low-pressure freshwater hose** to rinse off all acid residue.
- Rinse until the water runs clear and no foaming remains.
- Use a deck squeegee to remove excess water.

**Pro Tip:** Rinsing well is crucial! Leftover oxalic acid can dry into a powdery residue and dull the finish.

### 6. Dry and Inspect
- Allow the deck to air dry completely.
- Inspect for any uneven coloration or missed spots.
- If necessary, repeat the process on stubborn areas.

## Conclusion

A properly cleaned teak deck should have a uniform **honey-golden tone** with no dark patches or oxidation spots. The grain should be clearly visible, and the deck should feel **clean, smooth, and free from residue**. If the teak appears blotchy, it may need an additional rinse or a light repeat application.

**Pro Tip:** Avoid walking on the deck immediately after cleaning to prevent footprints or dirt from settling into the fresh surface.
